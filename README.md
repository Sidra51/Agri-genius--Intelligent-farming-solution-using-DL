# 🌾 AgriGenius – Intelligent Farming Solution Using Deep Learning

AgriGenius is an AI-powered farming assistant designed to detect plant diseases using deep learning and recommend suitable treatments. It empowers farmers and agricultural professionals by providing fast, accurate, and accessible crop diagnostics through image analysis.

---

## ✅ Features

- 📸 Upload leaf images to detect plant diseases
- 🧠 Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classification
- 🩺 Suggests treatment or cure for identified diseases
- 💡 Simple UI for non-technical users (Streamlit or Gradio supported)
- 🔄 Easily extendable to support new plant species or diseases

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras (for CNN model)
- OpenCV
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for analysis)
- Streamlit or Gradio (for UI)
- Scikit-learn (for evaluation)
- LabelImg (for data annotation if needed)

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sidra51/Agri-genius--Intelligent-farming-solution-using-DL.git
cd Agri-genius--Intelligent-farming-solution-using-DL
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train the Model (if not already trained)

```bash
python train_model.py
```

> Note: You can skip this if the `model/` folder already contains a trained model.

### 4. Run the App

#### Option A: Using Streamlit

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

#### Option B: Using Gradio (if implemented)

```bash
python app.py
```
